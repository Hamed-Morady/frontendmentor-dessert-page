# Product List with Cart | Frontend Mentor Challenge
## Description 
This project is a solution to the "Product List with Cart" challenge from Frontend Mentor. It is built using React, JavaScript, and CSS.

The goal of this challenge is to create a responsive product listing page with the ability to add and remove items from a shopping cart. Users can select product quantities, view cart details, and experience dynamic UI updates based on their interactions.

This project was built as a practice to improve my frontend development skills, particularly in managing component-based architecture with React and handling user interactions with clean, maintainable code. The application is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes.

2. On the homepage, you will see a list of products. You can:
    - Browse the available products.
    Select a product and specify its quantity. The product will be added to the shopping cart.

3. The shopping cart is located on the right side of the page:
    - See the list of items you've added.
    - Remove items or change their quantity.
    - Proceed to checkout when you're ready.
